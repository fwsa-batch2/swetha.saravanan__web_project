            <h2>Star Ferry</h2>
            <p>Hong Kong's famous Star Ferry, with roots dating back to 1880, costs only a 
                few Hong Kong Dollars to ride, making it one of the best deals in all of Hong Kong. Victoria
                 Harbour is a hive of activity, and ships of all shapes and sizes chug, zip, or wallow past
                  as the expert captains of the Star Ferries somehow avoid collisions.

            <h2>Hongkong Skyline</h2>
            <p>Hong Kong has one of the most impressive and recognizable skylines in the world.
                 The dense collection of skyscrapers, both on the island of Hong Kong and
                  in Kowloon, combined with the surrounding mountains and harbor set this city apart.</p>

            <p>You haven't seen the best of Hong Kong until you've taken in the skyline from
                 Victoria Peak, more commonly known as The Peak. Ride the tram to the top of this 
                 scenic viewpoint to see the skyscrapers, bustling city, harbor, and surrounding islands.</p>

            <h2>Big Buddha  (Tian Tan Buddha Statue)</h2>
            <p>The 34-meter-high "Big Buddha" sits above Lantau Island's Po Lin monastery, which 
                was a fairly secluded place until the statue was built in 1993. This is one of the
                 largest Buddha statues of its kind in the world and took 12 years to complete. The size 
                 is astounding, both up close and seen from a distance. The setting here is also 
                 incredible, surrounded by the green forest and views out over the ocean and islands.</p>

            <p>The Wong Tai Sin Temple is one of the newest in Hong Kong and also one of the 
                most interesting. Located in Kowloon, the original temple was a private structure 
                built in 1920. It was later replaced with a newer building in 1968, which is 
                what visitors see today.</p>

            <p>Major changes are planned for Ocean Park starting in 2021, with older rides being
                 replaced by new ones and with the park focusing more on marine conservation. 
                 Ocean Park is opening a new Mega Waterpark with 27 water features.</p>

            <p>The Tanka people who live in Tai O, found on Lantau Island, build their homes on 
                stilts over tidal flats. Villagers offer boat rides around the village, after which 
                you can visit the local markets and sample some of the fresh seafood. Occasional sightings
                 of the endangered pink dolphin occur in the nearby waters.</p>

            <p>For an escape from the city towers to a wide-open space with a bit of culture thrown in,
                 be sure to visit the Avenue of Stars. This is where the city pays homage to some of 
                 Hong Kong's best known film stars. Similar to the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, the Avenue 
                 of Stars is dedicated to Chinese performers.</p>
