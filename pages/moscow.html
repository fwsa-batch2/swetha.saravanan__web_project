    <h2 >Kremlin</h2>
        <p>Moscow's most recognizable structure is without a doubt the 
    Kremlin, a 15th-century fortified complex that covers an area of 275,000 
    square meters surrounded by walls built in the 1400s. The Grand Kremlin
     Palace-which has over 700 rooms-was once home to the Tsar family
 and is now the official residence of the president of the Russian Federation,
  although most heads of state choose to reside elsewhere.</p>

    <h2 >Bolshoi theatre</h2>
    <p>The Bolshoi Theater is home to the largest and one of the oldest 
ballet and opera companies in the world. While the theater has undergone 
several major renovations over the past century-including a recent one in 2011
to restore some of the imperial architectural details-it still retains all 
of its Neoclassical grandeur.</p>

            <h2 >Gum</h2>
            <p>Moscow's oldest and most upscale shopping center is an architectural
     marvel. GUM (short for Glávnyj Universálnyj Magazín or "Main Universal Store") 
     was built in the late 1800s in neo-Russian style to showcase a beautiful mix 
     of a steel skeleton and 20,000 panels of glass forming an arched roof.</p>

            <h2 > Red square</h2>
            <p>All of Moscow's main streets start at Red Square, so it's easy to see 
            why this is considered the heart of the city. A massive space of 330
             meters by 70 meters, the square is flanked by the Kremlin, 
             Lenin's Mausoleum, two cathedrals, and the State Historical
              Museum. </p>

            <h2 >Museum of Cosmonautics</h2>
            <p>At one point, Russia and the US were toe-to-toe when it came to space 
                exploration. While that might no longer be the case, the museum's amazing 
                collection-which includes over 85,000 items-is still awe-inspiring.</p>

            <h2>Arbut Streets</h2>
            <p>Moscow's one-kilometer-long pedestrian street has been around since
             the 15th century. Originally a trade route in the outskirts 
             of the city, Arbat Street is now very centrally located, home to posh buildings 
             and lots of places to eat and shop.</p>

            <h2 > Tretyakov Gallery</h2>
            <p>The largest collection of Russian art in the world sits here, with over
         180,000 paintings, sculptures, and religious art dating back to over a millennia ago.
          The gallery, built using beautiful red and white colors from classical Russian 
          architecture, is located near the Kremlin and it was built in the early 20th century. </p>

            <h2 > Krestovsky Stadium</h2>
            <p>Named after Sergey Kirov, the stadium was also home to the Zenit Football Club for 
                'certain periods in the 1900’s. The Fifa Confederations Cup took place in the 
                Krestovsky Stadium, with several group matches and the final between 
                Germany and Chile taking place at the stadium. The 2018 Fifa World Cup 
                also took place there, when Russia hosted the competition. </p>
