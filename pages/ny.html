            <p>America's most iconic sight, the Statue of Liberty is at the top of every first-time visitor's list of
                things to do in New York.
                It was France's gift to America. Built in 1886, it remains a world symbol of freedom and is one of the
                top attractions in America.
                It is one of the world's largest statues, standing just under 152 feet tall from the base to the torch,
                and weighing approximately 450,000 pounds.

            <p>A walk, peddle, or carriage ride through the crisscrossing pathways of Central Park is a must-do on
                anyone's New York City itinerary.
                In winter, you can even lace up your skates and glide across Wollman Rink. This huge park in the city
                center, a half-mile wide
                and 2.5 miles long, is one of the things that makes New York such a beautiful and livable city.</p>

                vast entertainment
                and shopping complex in the middle of Manhattan is home to NBC-TV and other media, but the centerpiece
                is the 70-story
                30 Rockefeller Plaza, an Art Deco skyscraper that offers awesome views over Manhattan from the famous
                Top of the Rock Observation Deck.

                the most famous

            <p>The Empire State Building is one of New York's most famous landmark buildings and key tourist
                attractions. The 381-meter-tall,
                102-storey building was the tallest in the world until the 1 World Trade Center tower rose higher, 41
                years later. Topped
                with a mooring mast for airships, the Empire State Building immediately became a landmark and a symbol
                for NYC when it opened in 1931.</p>

            <p>The Brooklyn Bridge, with its Gothic-shaped arches and suspension cables, is one of the city's most
                recognizable landmarks
                and has inspired generations of poets, songwriters, and painters. This historic bridge, spanning the
                East River from Manhattan
                to Brooklyn, was completed in 1883 and was the world's first steel suspension bridge. </p>
