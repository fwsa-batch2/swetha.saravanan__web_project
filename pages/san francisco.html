        <h2>Golden Gate Bridge</h2>
        <p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a California icon gracing San Francisco Bay. It is the
            most photographed site in the city, with the orange structure backed by blue water, or in
            many cases, peaking through low lying cloud. At night, the flood-lit structure is equally striking.</p>

            <h2>Alcatraz island</h2>
            <p>You can take a ferry over to the island and tour the site while listening to an exceptional
                audio recording that offers a glimpse into life in the prison, rather than just a historical list
                of the facts. The narration is even voiced by former inmates and guards of Alcatraz.</p>

            <p>These two uninhabited hills, more than 900 feet high, have one of the finest views out over
                the city and bay. Access is easy-you can drive to the north peak parking area, park your car,

                and largest grape-growing areas in California. Many people day trip to this area to enjoy
                the scenery and stop in at some of the sites along the way.</p>

                visiting the city. If you want to gaze out over the ball park to the sublime view of the ocean, buy
