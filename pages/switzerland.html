    <h2 >Matterhorn</h2>
        <p>The Matterhorn, Switzerland's iconic pointed peak is one of the highest mountains 
        in the Alps. On the border with Italy, this legendary peak rises to 4,478 meters,
        and its four steep faces lie in the direction of the compass points.
         The first summiting in 1865 ended tragically when four climbers fell to their death
          during the descent. Today, thousands of experienced climbers come here each summer.</p>

    <h2 >Jungfraujoch</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular things to do in the beautiful Bernese Oberland is 
    the train journey to Jungfraujoch, the "Top of Europe," with an observation terrace and 
    scientific observatory perched at 3,454 meters. The longest glacier in Europe, the Great Aletsch 
    Glacier begins at Jungfraujoch, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The famous Eiger Trail
     from the Eiger glacier station to Alpiglen clings to the rocks at the foot of the north face.</p>

            <p>Nestled between Lake Thun to the west and Lake Brienz to the east, 
            Interlaken is one of Switzerland's most popular summer holiday resorts. 
            In the center of town, Höhematte is a marvel of urban planning with 35 acres 
            of open space. Flower gardens, hotels, and cafés surround the Höheweg, 
            the main boulevard through here with breathtaking vistas of the mountains.</p>

            <p>Mirror-like lakes, glaciers, jagged peaks, alpine forests, and oodles of sunshine

          list of things to do in Switzerland. Palatial hotels and pricey restaurants are par

            <h2 >The Albula/Bernina Railway line</h2>
            <p>One of the very few railway lines in the world designated as a UNESCO World Cultural
             Heritage listing, the Albula/Bernina line on the Rheatian Railways offers a majestic
             ride not to be missed. The route extends throughout the Albula and Bernina 
             landscapes, covering 122 kilometers and winding through almost 200 bridges,
              the Graubünden mountains, and a number of tunnels and viaducts along the way.</p>

            <h2>The Rhine Falls</h2>
            <p>Spanning 150 meters, the Rhine Falls (Rheinfall) at Schaffhausen are the largest
             falls in Central Europe. The best time to visit is during June and July when 
             the mountain snow melts, and the falls swell in volume to spill over a 
             21-meter-high ledge of Jurassic limestone.</p>

            <h2 >Zurich</h2>
            <p>Zurich is Switzerland's largest city, a major transportation hub,
             and a top starting point for travelers. The city lies at the northwestern
              end of Lake Zurich astride the river Limmat. Beyond its buttoned-up façade,
               this affluent banking capital boasts a rich line-up of cultural treasures. </p>

            <h2 >Lake lugano and Ticino</h2>
            <p>Lake Lugano lies on the Swiss/Italian border in Ticino, Switzerland's
             only official Italian-speaking canton, and offers a tantalizing taste 
             of the Mediterranean. Citrus, figs, palms, and pomegranates flourish 
             in the mild climate here-even as snowcapped peaks beckon in the distance. </p>
